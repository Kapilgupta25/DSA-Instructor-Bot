# 🤖 DSA Instructor Bot

**DSA Instructor Bot** is an interactive **AI-powered chatbot** that helps users **learn and understand Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts in the **simplest possible way**.  
Built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, it leverages **Google’s Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to provide intelligent and topic-restricted responses.

## 🚀 Features

- 🚫 **Topic Restriction** – If the user asks non-DSA questions, the bot politely reminds them to stay on DSA topics.  
- 💬 **Simplified Explanations** – Breaks down complex DSA concepts into easy-to-understand language.  
- ⚡ **Powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash** – Uses Google’s latest generative model for fast and accurate responses.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a question in the chat interface.  
2. The app sends the prompt to the **Gemini 2.5 Flash model** using the **Google Generative Language API**.  
3. The `system_instruction` defines the model’s behavior —  
   - If the question is DSA-related → gives a clear, polite, and simple explanation.  
   - If it’s non-DSA → replies with a reminder to stick to DSA topics.  
4. The bot displays the AI’s response instantly in a smooth chat UI.
